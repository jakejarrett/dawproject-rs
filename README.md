# dawproject-rs

(I will update the repo in the coming days)

## Goals
- [ ] Ability to be able read the types in code
- [ ] Ability to import / use types and/or functions (Use case for own project)
- [ ] Ability to use this project to load & decode a dawproj file into rust structs.

## Extended goals (For pre-1.0 release, but post beta)
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Performance improvements (if needed)
